\description{
A dataset with management information derived from EPAMIG experimental
trials in Brazil, filtered for the cultivar BRILHANTE.
These data were processed in `data-raw/reference_egypt.R`.
}
\details{
These records were derived from EPAMIG trial data (`data-raw/data_epamig.csv`)
by summarising heading, harvest, disease severity, and yield across replicates,
then extracting only the sowing information relevant for management simulation.
