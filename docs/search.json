These factors collectively inform the understanding of disease dynamics and potential  🌧️ WEATHER–DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS Weather–disease associations: rainfall (r= 0.83 ); leaf-wetness (r= 0.71 ); t max (r= -0.03 ); t min (r= 0.11 ); rh max (r= 0.42 ); rh min (r= 0.45 ).  🍄 DISEASE DYNAMICS (CALENDAR DATES) The median timings for the observed season are as follows: onset on 05/26, rapid-rise on 06/09, and peak on 07/16. The total season length is approximately 280 days.  ⚕️ FUNGICIDE PROGRAM & TIMING Apply the first spray by 05/26 to align with the onset of disease. Given the late application pattern, ensure subsequent sprays are administered every 7–10 days, with the next application by 06/09. Applications often lagged the epidemic; advance the first spray to just before onset (≈ 05/26) and avoid long gaps during the rapid increase window (≈ 06/09).  🤖 MODEL PERFORMANCE Model–observation performance: • DisSev: RMSE≈0.22, R²≈0.89 (model underestimates) • LightInterception: RMSE≈0.13, R²≈0.95 (model underestimates)  📅 YEARLY HIGHLIGHTS • 1973: 85.8% severity; 840.6 kg/ha (87.4% loss).
